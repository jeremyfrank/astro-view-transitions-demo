excerpt: How a 17-Year-Old from Southwest D.C. Found Confidence 2,000 Miles from Home and 13,000 Feet in the Air
intro: Waking up to the sound of rain, Desahray Johnson began her day at Broken Arrow Ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It was August 7, 2022 and time for Johnson to begin her two-day climb up Grand Teton, a gruelling ascent 2.5 miles above sea level to the tallest peak in the Teton range.

Over the next two days on the mountain, Johnson would face heavy downpours, near freezing temperatures, mud and puddles that obscured the path, boulders so close that she’d turn sideways to slide between them, and vertical ascents that she both climbed up and rappelled back down.

“There were crazy moments,” says Johnson. “We were walking through clouds. And then you were hanging on to a cliff, relying on your fingertips. You're rappelling, holding your own body over the cliff and lower yourself with the rope like you’re a fish on a fishing rod. But you know what you’re doing. You're ready for this.”

## A City Kid in Wyoming

17 years old and a native of Southwest D.C., Johnson was a long way from home, but undaunted and well prepared for the trek. She was in Grand Teton National Park as part of City Kids Wilderness Project — a Washington, D.C. nonprofit that provides year-round outdoor programming for D.C. students in grades six through 12. Using wilderness settings to build resiliency, broaden horizons, develop life skills, and cultivate community, City Kids also provides career exploration, job training, and social justice workshops.

Johnson, like all City Kids, joined the program in sixth grade. She first attended a City Kids ziplining event in D.C., without realizing it was an opportunity to apply to the multi-year program. She was surprised when her mom received an email weeks later saying Johnson was invited to officially join the City Kids cohort and fly to Wyoming that summer.

At 12 years old, Johnson boarded a plane for the first time and joined her fellow City Kids participants in Wyoming. She would go on to make that flight five more times, once each summer, through middle school and high school.

As part of City Kids, Johnson takes part in hiking, biking, kayaking, and rock-climbing sessions throughout the school year. All of the training, the rock climbing lessons, the survival skills, and the group bonding culminated in this moment — the two-day hike up Grand Teton with a fellow participant, a City Kids staff member, and two guides.

The classic alpine peak has drawn climbers and adventurers for over 100 years and is so iconic that the national park takes its name from the summit. The summit sits at 13,776 feet. But what it lacks in elevation, it makes up for in technical climbing requirements. Ropes are required to scale the nearly vertical ascent at many parts.

“The Grand Climb was something I wasn’t scared to do. I really wanted to do it. I was excited,” says Johnson. “I felt good about doing it because it takes patience. It takes all of the learnings we learned over the years. It felt good putting all of those abilities together and have all of my survival skills come together to take two days to climb a mountain.”
