excerpt: Restoring Access to Ancestral Land Along the Musconetcong Wild and Scenic River
intro: Musconetcong Wild and Scenic River courses through western New Jersey’s highlands. The river is home to water buffalo and shad, and on any given day, you’ll find fishermen along the banks and paddlers working their way down stream.

You may also find Chief Vincent Mann, Turtle Clan Chief of the Ramapough Luunape Nation along the banks of the river. Mann is at the forefront of New Jersey’s environmental justice movement and operates a nonprofit farm used for both sustenance and to recover the Ramapough Luunape’s cultural farming practices. Seemingly with more than 24 hours in a day, Mann has also been instrumental in restoring and preserving the Musconetcong Wild and Scenic River and his tribe’s ancestral land surrounding the river.

The Musconetcong Wild and Scenic River is one of 18 Congressionally designated Partnership Wild and Scenic Rivers. These public-private partnerships recognize and celebrate nationally significant rivers in areas with mostly private land and no new federal land acquisition.

At each river, the National Park Service (NPS) forms a cooperative relationship with a local organization to promote and protect the river. At Musconetcong, that’s the Musconetcong Watershed Association (MWA). Today, Mann, MWA, the Student Conservation Association (SCA), the National Park Foundation (NPF), and NPS are part of a widespread community collaboration to preserve and protect the land alongside the river.

“Having the opportunity to work so closely with like-minded people, who have an Indigenous way of thinking, was really inspiring to us," said Mann.

The collaboration is helping repair 1.8 miles of trails along the river, creating access to land while carefully preserving the Ramapough Luunape Nation’s ancestral sites, including ceremonial stone landscapes and sacred land. The Musconetcong Watershed Association also hopes to add Indigenous language to signage in the future.

Preserving sacred land and protecting the unspoiled land and wildlife, all while creating visitor access, is no easy task. And an unlikely team of young stewards were on the job.
